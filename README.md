#
#   The routine bec-symmetry-breaking.py is Markov sampling method (generalised Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm) for calculating the
#   integrated (random) condensate wave field (order parameter) for a given total particle number, 
#   temperature and trap frequency of a Bose-Einstein condensate.

#   This software version corresponds to publication of Fluctuation and Noise Letters, Vol. 16, No. 01, 1750009 (2017).
#  
#   The Python routine bec_symmytry_breaking.py calculates :
#
#   1. Condensate field modes   	    	            	    	            	    	        
#   2. Condensate wave fields at equilibrium (symmetry aspects)    
#   3. Condensate wave field propagations (from low energy to high energy)    
#   4. Partial phase distributions of real valued field modes    
#   5. Partial phase distributions of imaginary valued field modes    
#   6. Total phases of the condensate wave field
#   7. Chemical potentials of the condensate
